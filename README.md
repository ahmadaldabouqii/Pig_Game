# Pig_Game

Pig Game (ludo) is a simple classic board dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

## GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 or two 6 in a row, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
- Players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100.
- Players can set two dices to the game. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1.

## How to win:

The player with the greater value on the side of the dice wins.
